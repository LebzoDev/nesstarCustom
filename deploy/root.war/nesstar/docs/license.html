      shall not electronically transfer the Software from one computer to another
      over a network </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h3>
<blockquote>
   <p><strong>4.1 Warranty on Media</strong><br>
      <strong>4.1.1</strong> Nesstar warrants that the web-installed software is
      free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period
      of 90 days from the date of delivery evidenced by the delivery note. Nesstar&#8217;s
      entire liability and the Licensee's exclusive remedy will be the replacement
      copy of Nesstar software not meeting Nesstar's limited warranty and which
      is returned to Nesstar with proof of authorised possession. Nesstar will have
      no responsibility to replace Nesstar software damaged by accident, abuse or
      misapplication.<br>
      <strong>4.2 Warranty on Software</strong><br>
      <strong>4.2.1</strong> Nesstar warrants that the Software will be fit for
      the purposes set out in Nesstar's Specification subject to clause 4.2.2 below.
      If there is no Specification the Software will be of satisfactory quality.
      The Licensee is responsible for the use of the Software, all results obtained
      and how these are interpreted. Nesstar does not warrant that the Software
      will meet the Licensee's requirements or that operation of the Software will
      be error or interruption free.<br>
      <strong>4.2.2</strong> The Warranty set out in 4.2.1 above shall not apply
      to Software used on or in connection with equipment which is not approved
      equipment as set out in Nesstar's Specification. If there is no Specification
      it is the Licensee's responsibility to assess whether the Software will operate
      on the Licensed Equipment or any replacement equipment (authorised by Nesstar)
      and no liability is accepted by Nesstar for failure of the Software's operation
      on the Licensed Equipment on which it is installed.<br>
      <strong>4.2.3</strong> Except as expressly provided herein, all other warranties
      whether implied by statute or common law or otherwise are hereby expressly
      excluded to the fullest extent permissible by law.<br>
      <strong>4.2.4</strong> In the event of any breach of Nesstar's warranty in
      this clause 4.2 (whether by reason of defective materials, production faults
      or otherwise) Nesstar's total liability shall be limited to the replacement
      or repair of the Software in question<br>
      <strong>4.2.5</strong> Nesstar shall not be liable to the Licensee for any
      consequential special or indirect loss or damage (whether for loss of profit
      or contracts or otherwise and whether arising from negligence, breach of contract
      or howsoever), even if Nesstar has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.<br>
      <strong>4.2.6</strong> In no event shall Nesstar's total liability to the
      Licensee for all damages, losses, and causes of action, whether in contract
      tort (including negligence) or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by the Licensee
      for the Software thereon PROVIDED THAT Nesstar does not seek to exclude or
      restrict its liability for death or personal injury resulting from its negligence.</p>

   <p><strong>4.3 Intellectual property rights</strong><br>
      <strong>4.3.1</strong> Nesstar does not warrant that use of the Software will
      not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party although
      it is unaware of any such possibility. . If the Licensee, having used all
      reasonable endeavours to do so, is unable to use the Software without infringing
      the intellectual property rights of a third party Nesstar may at its discretion
      subject always to the availability of a licence of such intellectual property
      rights either:<br>
      <strong>4.3.1.1</strong> pay any licence fee demanded by a third party for
      the use of the Software; or<br>
      <strong>4.3.1.2</strong> terminate the licence and refund the written down
      value (based on life of 5 years) of the purchase price appropriate to the
      Software<br>
      <strong>4.3.2</strong> In no event shall Nesstar's liability to the Licensee
      under or as a result of clause 4.3 exceed the sums paid to Nesstar by the
      Licensee for the alleged infringing Software.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. REFERENCING</h3>
<blockquote>
   <p><strong>5.1</strong> All reports, publications and presentations relating
      to the use of the Software must quote the name of the Software and its origin.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>6. TERMINATION</h3>
<blockquote>
   <p><strong>6.1</strong> This licence shall continue for the Licence Term unless
      terminated earlier by agreement of the parties or in accordance with this
      clause 6.<br>
      <strong>6.2</strong> The Licensee may terminate the licence at any time by
      destroying the Software and all copies thereof and by returning any Software
      Protection Device/password to Nesstar.<br>
      <strong>6.3</strong> The Licence will terminate immediately upon notice from
      Nesstar if the Licensee fails to comply with the provisions of this Licence.<br>
      <strong>6.4</strong> This Licence will terminate automatically if the Licensee
      shall commit any act of bankruptcy or become insolvent or go into liquidation
      or suffer a mortgagor or receiver to become entitled to possession of any
      of its assets or if any of the foregoing events are in the reasonable opinion
      of Nesstar threatened.<br>

<P>This product includes software developed by the Free Software Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</A>).
   For these components the following conditions apply:</P>
<B><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html#TOC1">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</A></B>

<P> Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation,
   Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted
   to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing
   it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.
   It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version
   2, hence the version number 2.1.]

<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
   follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
   library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
   from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in
   order to run.

<P>
   <B><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION
      AND MODIFICATION</A></B>

<P>
   <STRONG>0.</STRONG>
   This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
   other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
   this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".

<P>
   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

<P>
   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
   which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
   Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)

<P>
   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
   and installation of the library.

<P>
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
   running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
   such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
   on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
   writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
   and what the program that uses the Library does.

<P>
   <STRONG>1.</STRONG>
   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
   warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Library.

<P>
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
   fee.

<P>
   <STRONG>2.</STRONG>
   You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> The modified work must itself be a software library.
   <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> You must cause the files modified to carry prominent
      notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG> You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed
      at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
   <LI><STRONG>d)</STRONG> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a
      function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that
      uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
      invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event
      an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
      operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
   <P> (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
      purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
      Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function
      or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
      not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

   <P> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
      considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
      and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them
      as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of
      a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the
      whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
      licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
      regardless of who wrote it.

   <P> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
      works based on the Library.

   <P> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
      a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
      scope of this License.
</UL>
<P>
   <STRONG>3.</STRONG>
   You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
   these notices.

<P>
   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
   that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

<P>
   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
   the Library into a program that is not a library.

<P>
   <STRONG>4.</STRONG>
   You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
   must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.

<P>
   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
   distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<P>
   <STRONG>5.</STRONG>
   A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
   Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

<P>
   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
   Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

<P>
   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

<P>
   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
   structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
   functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
   file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
   work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
   Library will still fall under Section 6.)

<P>
   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

<P>
   <STRONG>6.</STRONG>
   As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
   link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
   work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
   modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.

<P>
   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
   of these things:
<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
      machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes
      were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2
      above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with
      the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
      and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink
      to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
      understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
      the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
      use the modified definitions.)
   <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking
      with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time
      a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather
      than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
      properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one,
      as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
      that the work was made with.
   <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for
      at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
      6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
   <LI><STRONG>d)</STRONG> If distribution of the work is made by offering access
      to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
      specified materials from the same place.
   <LI><STRONG>e)</STRONG> Verify that the user has already received a copy of
      these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</UL>
<P>
   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.

<P>
   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.

<P>
   <STRONG>7.</STRONG> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
   permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the
      same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.
      This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
   <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> Give prominent notice with the combined library of
      the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</UL>
<P>
   <STRONG>8.</STRONG> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
   the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
   or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<P>
   <STRONG>9.</STRONG>
   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.

<P>
   <STRONG>10.</STRONG>
   Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.

<P>
   <STRONG>11.</STRONG>
   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

<P>
   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

<P>
   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is
   implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.

<P>
   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<P>
   <STRONG>12.</STRONG>
   If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
   an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.

<P>
   <STRONG>13.</STRONG>
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

<P>
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.

<P>
   <STRONG>14.</STRONG>
   If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
   of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
   and reuse of software generally.

<P>
   <STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG>

<P>
   <STRONG>15.</STRONG>
   BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
   LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

<P>
   <STRONG>16.</STRONG>
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

<PRE>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
   follow. </P>
<B><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
   MODIFICATION</A></B>

<P>
   <STRONG>0.</STRONG>
   This License applies to any program or other work which contains
   a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
   refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
   means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
   language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
   the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

<P>
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
   running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
   is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
   Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
   Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

<P>
   <STRONG>1.</STRONG>
   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
   notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
   and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
   along with the Program.

<P>
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

<P>
   <STRONG>2.</STRONG>
   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
      notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
      that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
      under the terms of this License.
   <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
      in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including
      an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
      of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
      not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
      is not required to print an announcement.)
</UL>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<P>
   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Program.

<P>
   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
   with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
   the scope of this License.

<P>
   <STRONG>3.</STRONG>
   You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
   under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<UL>
   <LI><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
      2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
   <LI><STRONG>b)</STRONG> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
      three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
      of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
      copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms
      of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
      or,
   <LI><STRONG>c)</STRONG> Accompany it with the information you received as
      to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
      is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
      the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord
      with Subsection b above.)
</UL>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<P>
   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
   access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
   access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
   distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<P>
   <STRONG>4.</STRONG>
   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
   this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

<P>
   <STRONG>5.</STRONG>
   You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Program or works based on it.

<P>
   <STRONG>6.</STRONG>
   Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this License.

<P>
   <STRONG>7.</STRONG>
   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,

   <B>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</B>
   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary
   programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more
   useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this
   is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of
   this License.
